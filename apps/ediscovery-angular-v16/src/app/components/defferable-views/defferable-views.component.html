        # Lazy Loading before Angular 17
      </h1>

      <p class="my-2">
        Before Angular 17 we had a couple of ways to reduce bundle size for our
        application. The first one is a well-known router based lazy loading.
        <img src="../../../assets/lazy-loading-example-1.png" class="my-2" />
        I just take a route and in the
        <span class="font-bold">loadComponent</span> property I can define this
        simple simple notation which instructs Angular that the JavaScript code
        for this component has to be removed from the main application bundle
        size and loaded only when this road is activated.

      </p>
      <hr class="my-3" />

      <!-- defer block in action -->
      <div class="bg-white rounded px-4 py-2">
        <h1 class="text-2xl font-medium text-[#fe31d2]">
          # defer block in action
        </h1>
        <hr class="my-1" />
        <p class="my-2">
          Starting with <span class="text-[#7f0cf1]">Angular 17</span> the same
          functionality we can implement by wrapping our heavy component that we
          want to Lazy Load with this brand new
          <span class="text-[#fe31d2]">&#64;defer</span> block just like below.
          <img src="../../../assets/deferrable-views-3.png" class="my-2" />
          With this new approach we will write less code, more declarative code
          and intention of the code is clear.
          <br />
          <br />
          If we want to investigate the compiled code of this component with
          defferable view block we will see that during the compilation phase
          the Angular compiler transforms this notation into a bunch of
          functions. The first function is the defer function which performs all
          the magic. Angular perform very similar thing that we did in the
          <span class="text-[#7f0cf1]"># Recognize the Problem</span>, but on
          the lower lever using the internal Angular API and the data structures

    <!-- Recognize the Problem -->

      <h1 class="text-2xl font-medium text-[#fe31d2]">
        # Recognize the Problem
      </h1>
      <hr class="my-1" />
      <p class="my-2">
        Sometimes our apps are designed in such a way so that lazy chunk has to
        be loaded based on some
        <span class="text-[#fe31d2] font-medium">certain component state</span>
        or <span class="text-[#fe31d2] font-medium">event</span> instead of the
        Angular router state as in the previous example with Lazy Loading.
        <br />
        <br />
        It is also possible even with the older Angular version, but the
        solution would not be simple because it involves some in-depth knowledge
        about
        <span class="text-[#7f0cf1] font-medium">ES6 Dynamic Imports</span> and
        <span class="text-[#7f0cf1] font-medium"
          >Dynamic Components Creation</span
        >
        and additional work from our side.
        <br />
        <br />
        The simplest solution might look like this one where we can distinguish
        two faces:
        <span class="text-[#7f0cf1] font-medium">1. chunk loading</span> and
        <span class="text-[#7f0cf1] font-medium"
          >2. component activation phase</span
        >
        <img src="../../../assets/deferrable-views-1.png" class="my-2" />
        The loading stage would look like the usage of Angular dynamic import
        which at build time instructs Angular bundler that this component has to
        be chunked out from the main bundle and at run time the same piece of
        code will load this chunk from the endpoint and from there we can
        destructure already their component class, however is not enough just to
        load their component, we need to dynamically created in order to see it
        on the page and this is something that we do during the second phase
        which involves also multiple steps like:
        <span class="text-[#7f0cf1] font-medium"
          >1. defining container element</span
        >
        in the template,
        <span class="text-[#7f0cf1] font-medium"
          >2. get reference to this container</span
        >
        and finally we can
        <span class="text-[#7f0cf1] font-medium"
          >3. create component instance.</span
        >
        <br />
        <img src="../../../assets/deferrable-views-2.png" class="my-2" />
        Quite a lot of code and I didn't speak about things like showing the
        loader during the chunk loading or error handling and many other things
        we need to care about in real usecases.

      <h1 class="font-bold text-xl text-[#fe31d2] my-2">&#64;placeholder</h1>
      <hr />
      <p class="my-2">
        Before the lazy component it is loaded and activated we would like to
        show some placeholder to give the user some visual feedback that
        something is going on and it is straightforward to achieve with the
        dedicated
        <span class="font-medium text-[#7f0cf1]">&#64;placeholder</span> block.
        <img src="../../../assets/deferrable-views-5.png" class="my-2" />
        The content defined inside this block will be shown before the lazy
        content is activated.
      </p>

      <!-- @loading -->
      <h1 class="font-bold text-xl text-[#fe31d2] my-2">&#64;loading</h1>
      <hr />
      <p class="my-2">
        Sometimes we want to notify users specifically about the chunk loading.
        For that there is another block called loading that works very similar
        previous blocks. The content inside the curly braces will be shown
        during this phase.
        <img src="../../../assets/deferrable-views-7.png" class="my-2 m-auto" />
        The difference between loading and placeholder blocks can be confusing
        because when we Load and Activate the defer block then the loading block
        immediately overlaps the placeholder block and you may think that those
        two states are interchangeable, but these two are different stages in
        the process.
        <img src="../../../assets/deferrable-views-8.png" class="my-2 m-auto" />
        The <span class="font-bold text-[#fe31d2]">chunk loading</span> stage is
        a part of the
        <span class="font-bold text-[#fe31d2]"

      <h1 class="font-bold text-xl text-[#fe31d2] my-2">&#64;error</h1>

        In the case when the lazy chunk couldn't be loaded we can show user the
        template inside error block.

        <span class="font-bold text-[#7f0cf1]">&#64;error</span>, will be
        eagerly loaded and will be bundled into the main bundle, we need to keep
        in mind that.
